# About Online Job Portal

An online job portal is a website or platform that connects job seekers with potential employers. These portals typically allow job seekers to create profiles, upload resumes, and search for job openings based on various criteria, such as location, industry, and job type.

Employers, on the other hand, can post job openings on the portal, search for resumes and profiles of potential candidates, and communicate with job seekers directly through the platform.

Some popular online job portals include LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Monster, and CareerBuilder. These portals are used by millions of people worldwide to find job opportunities and connect with potential employers.

Online job portals have become an essential tool for job seekers and employers in today's digital age. They provide a convenient and efficient way to search for job openings and candidates, saving both time and effort compared to traditional job search methods.
